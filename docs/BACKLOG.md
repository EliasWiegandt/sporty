# Backlog (short-horizon)

Now
- Implement Worker proxy for `/api/submit` with `BACKEND_URL` + `BACKEND_API_KEY`.
- Add `/healthz` on backend and route on Worker.
- Improve frontend form UX (required fields, better errors, loading state).

Next
- Sports taxonomy v0 (list + attributes) and data model draft.
- Decide on Supabase setup; create dev project and schemas.
- Add result page that renders ranked suggestions nicely.

Later
- Supabase auth stub (login/signup UI, no persistence yet).
- Scoring function v1; plug into backend.
- Add simple analytics (page views + submission counts).
